I think that I would use the MIT License for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is apparently the most widely-used open-source
license. This way, I would be able to get the majority of open-source contributors to consider adding to my community.
Secondly, I would want to use the MIT License because it is lower risk. By that, I mean that it doesn't have real limiting
legal-conditions. Mainly, I want this so that I can change and move the open-source software in a direction that the
community sees fit. I don't want to have to conform due to legal reasons and risk losing some people's interest because of it.
Also, it makes avoiding copyright issues easier as well.
