Article 1 Reflections:


- It's interesting to me that companies essentially "work together" by sharing open-source projects. It's kind of nice to
know that advancement in tech reaches further than corporate secrecy.

- It's also interesting that a lot of the want to work on open-source comes from intrinsic motivation.

- This article also brought up something that I'm personally interested in: the want to participate in open-source for
developement experience.

- Overall, the amount of reasons to get into open-source surprised me, I did not think that there would be more than like 3
different reasons to participate in open-source, but this article really opened up my mind.

Article 2 Reflections:


- This article is really helpful, and I think should be displayed to more people just getting into programming as a way to
introduce open-source software.

- It is kind of crazy to me that over 13.5 thousand developers from over 1300 companies have contributed to linux kernal.

- This article gives a really good overview of the structure (or at least groups of people) involved with open-source. It's
interesting how there is almost a company-like structure within open-source projects themselves despite the people working on
them working for different companies a lot of the time. It's almost like a bridge company between companies that hardly anyone
knows about.

- This was mentioned, and was something I was curious about. Do most open-source communities have systems set up so that
mentors are available to newer members? Or is it something that has to be sought out outside of the open-source system usually?

- Another question about the article. It mentions that you should start small when beginning to work in open-source
communities, but it doesn't really explain when you should start tackling harder/more interesting problems. Is it usually
apparent, or is it that you are generally sought-out for problems eventually after working for a certain amount.

- Overall, this article was very interesting, I liked how it went over a lot of the different parts of the structure of
open-source, and gave a very good introduction on how to begin and progress your career as an open-source developer.
