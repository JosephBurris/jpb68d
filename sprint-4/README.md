So, the hardest part about this is probably the setup that I had to go through.

1.) Download XAMPP or some sort of application that will let you run localhost through your machine (specifically an Apache web server.

2.) Turn on the Apache web server in XAMPP (or whatever app you chose)

3.) Place the 2 documents (home.php/index.php) directly into the htdocs folder for XAMPP (I'm not entirely sure what to do for
other applications, but essentially for XAMPP, I have to place the 2 documents directly into the localhost environment because
for some reason I could not get okta to use a folder within a localhost environment)

4.) Start up a browser of your choice, and type in: "http://localhost" into the search bar, and you should be greeted by a 
simple page that says "Not logged in" at the top.

5.) Click the login button which should take you into a login page.

6.) Use these credentials to log in: (Email:) test162345@gmail.com (Pass:) Opensaysm3

7.) Admire the home.php page or just logout
