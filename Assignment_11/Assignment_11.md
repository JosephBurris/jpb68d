I attended the group meeting that took place on April 7. (And thought it was pretty neat)

For the podcast, I really liked the introduction as to why CHAOSS was started, and what it's all about. Having people talk
about their individual experience and showing how they came to work on CHAOSS helped, I thought, reduce it into a more
comprehensive idea. Reducing it down made it seem a ton more friendly, and it felt like you could start helping just the same.
Also, another thing that helped break it down was a lot of different people's stories of how they got involved with open-source
projects. Showing that you don't have to have a PHD-level experience to be able to help out really made it seem possible to do.

Also, after being in the weekly meetup, I think that the logo for the podcast looks cool.
