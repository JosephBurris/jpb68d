Discussion Summary:
- The beginning seems to be about recapping some points talked about from previous meetings. About the proposition of new
metrics, and the deletion of some older ones that would get replaced as a result from the new metric
(I assume that the main part that we are supposed to summarize is the critique of our classmate's/new metrics)
- Inactive contributors metric
  - Should count total contributions over time, not just commits
  - Format for proposed metric should be changed by the creator slightly to match overall format
  - Implementation section should be formatted slightly differently
    - Not included in google doc (needs to be updated) or a new document should be created to help explain
    - New document including the new information is then edited and then added
  - Objectives section is redundant. Keep the first sentence and delete the rest (in order to reduce redundancy).
  - "period" and "cutoff" in implementation needs to be changed to "interval"
  - Some grammatical errors need to be fixed in the metric.
- Code length metric
  - Debate over whether this should stay in evolution, or go to another repository/group
    - Should "current state" type metrics stay in evolution?
- Recap, and end of session.
